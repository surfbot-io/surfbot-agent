# `surfbot agent-spec` — LLM interface

`agent-spec` emits a self-describing JSON (or markdown) contract of every
Surfbot CLI command. Give the JSON output to a cold LLM and it has
everything it needs to drive Surfbot atomically: subcommands, flags,
positional args, input/output types, composition rules, and canonical
recipes.

## Quick start

```sh
surfbot agent-spec --format json > surfbot.spec.json
```

Then in your LLM prompt:

> You are operating Surfbot via a shell. Use only the commands and
> schemas described in the attached spec. Chain atomic commands via the
> declared pipe rules.

Attach `surfbot.spec.json`. Done.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--format json\|md` | `json` | Output format. JSON is the canonical contract; md is for humans. |
| `--command <name>` | "" | Return spec for a single command (dotted path, e.g. `findings.list`). |
| `--schema-only` | false | Emit only types + per-command input/output schema refs. Smaller payload for prompt injection. |
| `--version` | false | Print only the spec version and agent version. |

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` unknown `--command`, `1` any other error.

## Document shape

See `internal/cli/agent_spec.go` for the canonical Go types. Top-level:

```
{
  spec_version, agent_version, generated_at, binary, description,
  global_flags: [...],
  commands:     [{name, path, summary, category, flags, input, output, examples, ...}],
  types:        {TypeName: JSONSchemaFragment, ...},
  composition:  {pipes: [...], recipes: [...]}
}
```

### Command categories

- `atomic-detection` — a direct wrapper over a detection tool (discover, resolve, portscan, probe, assess)
- `scan` — the orchestrated recipe over all atomic tools
- `target`, `findings`, `assets`, `score`, `status` — state management
- `daemon` — OS service subcommands
- `meta` — everything else (`tools`, `version`, `agent-spec`, `fix`, `connectors`)

### Composition

`composition.pipes` declares which commands can be piped into which:
a consumer's `input.type` is compatible with a producer's `output.type`.
`composition.recipes` declares canonical named compositions — today only
`scan`, which mirrors the live `surfbot scan` pipeline.

## Scope guarantees

Surfbot will not persist assets whose hostname lies outside the declared
target scope. When a target hostname resolves to a shared IP (CDN, cloud
PaaS, shared hosting), Surfbot sends the target hostname as the HTTP
`Host` header so the server returns the intended vhost. If the server
responds with a different vhost — detected by comparing the final URL
hostname and TLS certificate SANs against the expected hostname — the
response is dropped silently and logged to stderr with
`reason=vhost_mismatch`.

**Input formats for `probe`:**

- `hostname|ip:port/tcp` — scoped probe. Request goes to the IP, `Host`
  header is set to the hostname. Response is dropped if the effective
  host does not match.
- `ip:port/tcp` — IP-pure probe. No `Host` override, no scope check.
  Whatever the server returns is persisted under the IP.
- `hostname` — DNS-resolved probe, self-scoped. Off-site redirects
  trigger the drop.

The `scan` pipeline produces `hostname|ip:port/tcp` automatically by
pairing resolved IPs with their originating hostnames.

**Observability:** each drop emits one stderr line in key=value form:

```
reason=vhost_mismatch expected_host=<h> observed_host=<h> ip=<ip> port=<p> status=<code>
```

The total is accumulated on the run's `ToolRun.Config["vhost_mismatch_drops"]`.

## Stability

`spec_version` is semver:
- **major** — breaking changes (removed commands, renamed fields)
- **minor** — additive (new commands, new optional fields)
- **patch** — doc/description changes only

Current: **1.1.0**.

## Design notes

- Generated at runtime from the live Cobra tree. Never ship a
  hand-maintained JSON file — it will drift.
- Type schemas are hand-coded in `internal/cli/agent_spec_schemas.go`
  (pinned to `internal/model` structs via tests). If a model struct
  changes, update the schema deliberately.
- `agent-spec` is in `skipDBCommands` — it never opens the SQLite store.
  Safe to run with `--db /nonexistent/path`.
- Invariant tests in `internal/cli/agent_spec_test.go` enforce
  completeness (every Cobra command in the spec), detection coverage,
  pipe consistency, and recipe executability against the live tree.
